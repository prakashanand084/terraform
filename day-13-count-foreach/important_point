Which One Should You Use?
✅ Use count when:

You need a fixed number of identical resources.
The order of resources is not important.
You are working with a simple list.
✅ Use for_each when:

You need unique resource names or properties.
You are working with a map or a set.
You want to avoid unnecessary re-creation of resources.
Final Thoughts
If you just need a specific number of resources, go with count.
If each resource needs a unique name or property, use for_each.
If you are working with a map or set, for_each is the better choice.
If you want to avoid resource recreation due to index shifting, for_each is safer.
